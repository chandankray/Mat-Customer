Absolutely — let’s walk through all the steps in detail, including prerequisites and important actions, so you can confidently restore your RDS SQL Server database in another region and resume DMS CDC-based replication.

Full Plan: Sync RDS SQL Server to Another Region Using Backup + DMS


---

Prerequisites

Item	Description

DMS is already set up	You have an existing DMS replication task (full load + CDC or CDC-only)
Source is RDS SQL Server	CDC is enabled and running on the source database
Target is also RDS SQL Server	A database exists in another region, but it’s out of sync
IAM roles	You’ve created and attached an IAM role that allows RDS access to an S3 bucket (source and target regions)
Option group	Both source and target RDS instances have an option group with SQLSERVER_BACKUP_RESTORE enabled



---

Step-by-Step


---

STEP 1: Pause Your DMS Task

Why: Prevent data inconsistency or errors while syncing the target DB.

Go to AWS DMS Console → Select your Task → Stop

Ensure it’s not writing to the out-of-sync target anymore



---

STEP 2: Prepare Source DB for Backup

Goal: Ensure CDC metadata is preserved and intact for restore.

a) Confirm CDC is enabled:

SELECT is_cdc_enabled FROM sys.databases WHERE name = 'YourDB';
SELECT name, is_tracked_by_cdc FROM sys.tables WHERE is_tracked_by_cdc = 1;

If not, enable it:

EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_db;

EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_table  
  @source_schema = 'dbo',  
  @source_name = 'YourTable',  
  @role_name = NULL;

b) Ensure FULL Recovery Mode:

SELECT name, recovery_model_desc FROM sys.databases WHERE name = 'YourDB';

If not FULL:

ALTER DATABASE YourDB SET RECOVERY FULL;
BACKUP DATABASE YourDB TO DISK = 'nul'; -- dummy backup to finalize mode

c) Record the Current LSN (for CDC resume):

SELECT sys.fn_cdc_get_max_lsn() AS MaxLSN;

Save this LSN if you need to specify a resume point.

d) Stop CDC Cleanup Job (temporarily):

EXEC sys.sp_cdc_stop_job @job_type = 'cleanup';

> Optional: Extend CDC retention:



EXEC sys.sp_cdc_change_job @job_type = 'cleanup', @retention = 4320; -- 3 days


---

STEP 3: Backup Source DB to S3

Make sure:

SQLSERVER_BACKUP_RESTORE option is added to the RDS instance

IAM role is attached to the instance


Command:

EXEC msdb.dbo.rds_backup_database 
  @source_db_name='YourDB', 
  @s3_arn_to_backup_to='arn:aws:s3:::your-source-bucket/YourDB.bak', 
  @overwrite_S3_backup_file=1;

Monitor task:

EXEC msdb.dbo.rds_task_status @db_name='YourDB';


---

STEP 4: Copy Backup to Other Region

Use AWS CLI:

aws s3 cp s3://your-source-bucket/YourDB.bak s3://your-target-bucket/YourDB.bak \
  --source-region us-east-1 \
  --region us-west-2


---

STEP 5: Restore DB on Target RDS in New Region

Ensure:

SQL Server RDS in target region exists

SQLSERVER_BACKUP_RESTORE option is added

IAM role with S3 access is attached


Run on target DB:

EXEC msdb.dbo.rds_restore_database 
  @restore_db_name='YourDB', 
  @s3_arn_to_restore_from='arn:aws:s3:::your-target-bucket/YourDB.bak';

Wait for task to complete:

EXEC msdb.dbo.rds_task_status @db_name='YourDB';


---

STEP 6: Validate CDC on Restored Target

CDC should remain intact, but verify:

-- Is CDC enabled on the DB?
SELECT is_cdc_enabled FROM sys.databases WHERE name = 'YourDB';

-- Are tables tracked by CDC?
SELECT name, is_tracked_by_cdc FROM sys.tables WHERE is_tracked_by_cdc = 1;

If not enabled, re-enable:

EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_db;
EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_table @source_schema='dbo', @source_name='YourTable', @role_name=NULL;

Check for CDC jobs (optional):

SELECT * FROM msdb.dbo.cdc_jobs;


---

STEP 7: Resume DMS CDC Replication

1. Go to AWS DMS Console


2. Choose your existing replication task


3. Modify it to use:

"CDC only" mode

Start point:

Let DMS resume from checkpoint (default), or

Provide start LSN (if you recorded it earlier)




4. Start the DMS task




---

STEP 8: Monitor and Confirm Sync

Use DMS Table Statistics and CloudWatch logs

Watch for:

CDC latency

LSN mismatch errors

Tables in "error" state




---

STEP 9: Cleanup

Once replication is healthy:

Restart CDC cleanup:


EXEC sys.sp_cdc_start_job @job_type = 'cleanup';

Optionally delete the .bak files from S3

Summary Table

Step	Description

1	Pause DMS task
2	Validate CDC + record LSN on source
3	Backup to S3 using native backup
4	Copy .bak to other region
5	Restore .bak to target RDS
6	Validate or re-enable CDC on target
7	Resume DMS with CDC-only mode
8	Monitor sync health
